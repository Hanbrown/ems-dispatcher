# EMS Dispatcher Software

This web app helps First Aid dispatchers keep track of their medical units

version 1.0.0 Beta

## Description

A user should be able to quickly find out what med units are available, which ones are on break, which ones are on a call, and which ones are en route to a call/place.

Users should be able to quickly change the state of a med unit with a quick command. Hopefully, a GUI option will be added -- but the command line should be the go-to solution.

Design should be minimal and functional -- but it should absolutely be __readable__.

## MVP
- Table with each med unit
- Highlights based on availability
- Emphasis on readability over style and effects

### Desired Features
- Allowing breaks/lunch timers
- Stopwatch for calls 
- Time last updated 
- Sort entries by number, label, status, etc
- Group units (add spacing)
- Cookies to prevent data loss on reload

## Technologies
- Bootstrap  
- React JS
- SASS
- Webpack/Babel
