# EMS Dispatcher Software

This web app helps First Aid dispatchers keep track of their medical units

version 1.1.1 Beta

## Description

A user should be able to quickly find out what med units are available, which ones are on break, which ones are on a call, and which ones are en route to a call/place.

Users should be able to quickly change the state of a med unit with a quick edit. Hopefully, a command line option will be added.

Design should be minimal and functional -- but it should absolutely be __readable__.

## MVP
- Table with each med unit
- Highlights based on availability
- Emphasis on readability over style and effects

### Desired Features
- Sort entries by number, label, status, etc (Partially Completed)
- Change styling so all units can be seen at once
- Cookies to prevent data loss on reload
- Access across multiple devices


- Allowing breaks/lunch timers
- Stopwatch for calls
- Parsing Excel docs for quick setup

## Technologies
- Bootstrap  
- React JS
- SASS
- Webpack/Babel
